This project automatically calibrates the SimpopLocal model given 3 objective usign a genetic algorithm, distributed on a computation grid. The workflow runs 200000 hours of computation. The model sources are available in the model directory. The result have been published in 2 papers:
* [Half a billion simulations: evolutionary algorithms and distributed computing for calibrating the SimpopLocal geographical model](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01118918v1)
* [A New Method to Evaluate Simulation Models: The Calibration Profile (CP) Algorithm](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/18/1/12.html)
