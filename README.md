# openmole-market

The OpenMOLE marketplace contains complete examples of real world workflows.

They are maint to be concise with the main focus put on the workflow script.
Still they should be easily reusable and any material required by the workflow (scripts, binaries, input data, ...) should be provided to make sure a **Minimum Working Example** is available.

## How to contribute ##

  - Fork this repository
  - Create a new folder for your workflow example
  - Add all the required dependencies and a subset of the input data
  - Edit the top-level README.md to add your new entry
  - Create a Pull Request for us to review your submission

All the accepted submissions will be part of the market place and will be compiled against the last version of OpenMOLE. The available entries are also available from the OpenMOLE website: [http://next.openmole.org/Documentation_Market%20Place_All.html](http://next.openmole.org/Documentation_Market%20Place_All.html)

## Available workflows ##

  - [R hello world](R-hello): a *Hello world* in R ranging over 100 of different inputs.
  - [Ants model](ants): a NetLogo model calibrated using the Evolutionary/Genetic Algorithms.
  - [Fire simulation](fire): a fire simulation model in Netlogo with a design of experiments studying its density factor.
  - [OpenMOLE plugin](hello-plugin): two workflows using two different OpenMOLE plugins.
  - [Java hello wold](java-hello): an example of how to embed Java code in OpenMOLE.
  - [Pi Monte Carlo approximation](pi): a workflow using a ScalaTask to approximate the value of Pi. The Design of Experiments changes the seed of the random number generator.
  - [Random Forest classifier](randomforest): This workflow explores the parameters of a random forest image classifier written in Python using scikit-learn.
  - [SimPopLocal model](simpoplocal): A geographical model calibrated using genetic algorithms.
